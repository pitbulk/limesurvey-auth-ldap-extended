Description
===========

This is a LimeSurvey extension that extends the LDAP support offered by the core plugin.

It allows you to update full name/email on each login action.

The extension supports Groups. If the LDAP provides a group name, you can enable Sync group option to update the user group. If the group name provided does not exist yet, you can enable Auto-create groups field to generate it automatically.
The same applies to roles.

It also allows for auditing LDAP actions by enabling a logger.
